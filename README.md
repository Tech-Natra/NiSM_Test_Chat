Where can we find our roll no ?
In the google sheet shared regarding our pgp email ids
Prowess IQ that excel sheet ?
so email ids are only roll no
still can't access the student portal
"forbidden access.. trying different browser, removed personal gmail. nothing works"
same link for tomorrow class ?
"Sub Class Schedule June 02, 2024 | PGP 2024-25 | Trimester - I"
Sessions are recordable via Zoom on local device
That might invoke most of the NISM code of conduct laws.
Is this the correct link for student portal?
Pls any one respond on this
"Try ""http"" instead of ""https"". That worked for me"
I was about to tell  Sir when session ended
"Hi Person_7, there is one more trader group by our friend Person_41. I request to tie up with  him and have only one trader group. By the way,  it's a great initiative by both of you."
 bhai..plz share link of another trading group which u created
"No no, i did not create a new group"
"If you click on the link, it will take you to the same group"
 by the way u saved Person_54 das really well  So nice of u to display such team spirit
"I think it is still optional, you can attend the sessions online anytime. However, on the contrary if you had not opted for physical seat but yet you went to the centre, then it will be prioritized for the ones who already enrolled for the physical seats, if seat still empty then 1st come 1st serve basis."
"Sorry, I didn't check, I thought it is different group"
On NISM student portal my birth year is showing 1951 ...I sent mail regarding this also...
Mine also same ..I think everyone DOB is incorrect
"Team, do we need use yesterday’s link?"

I Have too but I will go for Portfolio Management Services & Investment Advisory courses as well  
"Friends, Any way we can get lecture recordings."
"Have you downloaded, please share direct link if possible."

" Person_15, Can you pin this or put in the description? 2/6/24, 6:52 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
We will also engage in a statistical exercise.
Which drink do you prefer to keep yourself awake during afternoon sessions? OPTION: Tea (5 votes) OPTION: Coffee (6 votes) OPTION: Red Bull (1 vote) OPTION: Finance is my stimulant (4 votes)
Kindly cast your vote. Also an interesting observation by Malay Person_22 before he was interrupted
Something to add to what malay sir mentioned.   One should never look at only PE of a stock. Comparing it to benchmark PE or sectoral PE doesn’t give the true picture.
There are n number of examples on how PE can be manipulated and is manipulated by managements.
"PE just one of the parameter to compare valuation. We need to look at DEBT to equity, future business earning possibility,  future business model or management sales etc all into account. Best way to ask yourself this question, why the company PE is low ? Means why the company is under appreciated by participant?  If you find the answer and still if you feel is market has over reacted on small negatives of the company, then you can say, it is undervalued. This is my take on the subject"
"One example was Adani  Green ..even at PE 40-50 etc, if someone miss it thinking overvaluation, it went up by 5 -10 times from that value. Because future business earning possibilities was much higher."
Absolutely    Too many factors one has to consider to come to a conclusion.
"Sometimes, one time profit can inflate the PE for short duration giving an impression of higher PE"
Change in accounting policy is one of the worst ways that managements change the PE on their stock
Yes...I was saying either way can give wrong impression
This current lecture is going bounce from my mind
Same here...I m noting down the terminology to check later...list is going on
The slides i m getting the discussion i m not
Arre simple hai bhai..Zeroing onto cluster sampling statistics null hypothesis interval inference karna hai bass..
Please share once done. Will be really helpful
I slept for whole second lecture after 1 pm
"guruji bole enjoy karo, to bas aaj sirf enjoy karo. deep dive class will start from next week"
"Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, kurtosis, skewness, statistics, sample, population, parameter, central tendency, confidence interval, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, Inferential statistics"
ye lecture kaahe khatam nahi ho raha?
15 is the scheduled time. After that doubts will be discussed. Then Mr.  would come up with the rules and regulations.
Probability that a particular estimation has the chance of being wrong in the long run
U r very significant for this group  Seems u have a good idea about this stuff.. We will keep coming back to u in case of doubts.. We have 95% confidence on u
15  PM. Remember it's Sunday evening
I came here for securities markets and now I have insecurities
"Sure will try to answer based on my understanding of the subject. But studied it 2 years back, need to brush up on the concepts."
"After this lecture,,I have decided to not opt for research analyst"
Same here. I am not understanding ki I am understanding or not understanding.
"I don't think you need to worry.. Being a post graduate program, we dive into the details/theory. Take it that way.."
5 already. No more questions please
Statistical Valuation is not that difficult but he is just going randomly about the lecture. No chronology of the topics.
abhi bhi chal raha hai 
I today feel lucky I dozed off
You are lucky..I'm sick now --going to take medicine  
"Any book u refer? 2/6/24, 9:44 pm - SA: Try this statistics in plain english"
Read the Master Circular published on 21st May 2024 on Research Analysts and Investment Analysts 
This lecture is nothing in front of it 
this Person_58 question brought some life in the class 
Isn't the lecture supposed to end at 1715
I think it must be so interesting that it is going into overtime
"Had I known this, I would have joined at 4"
Ya ya..absolutely... Based on ordinal data hypothesis of pca qualitative deduction of regression it's interesting
Person_58 event proves that Statistics is 3rd lie sir was talking about
"Techies in our group to pls take additional classes on same 2/6/24, 10:33 pm - SA: Sir, he was too fast for sure you folks can crack without too much stats plus there are already tools available  What you need to build is skills to interpret the stats output."
Does anyone have any idea about model questions / previous year’s questions 
He was as fast as vande bharat
Most Confident & Smiling Trader I Have Seen Till Now ! Despite Openly Revealing he is at 50 Lakhs Loss! !  
Where can we download the video lectures?
They were recording the class right?
They were recording but available to us
In case of emergency you ask for recording via mail
But that's also available for 3 days
Just sharing the presentation slides isn't sufficient. During the live lectures a lot of other things are discussed by the Faculty apart from the slides which can be important from the examination point of view.
I always very honest  Never give up guys  LOSSESES IS A TUITION FEES  We will be next Jhunjhun WALA 
I think they will examine us more on practicality than theoretically
I would be interested in collaborating on doing fundamental research on any equities if anyone has any particular stocks.
Yes I am talking abt the practical aspects being discussed in the live lectures.
Sahi baat hai... even I lost around 2 lakh in options. Than decided not to do options until I mastered in cash segment
For that we can note down some points
"If they r not gonna share the video, then that seems the only option."
While doing this we can miss during live sessions.
What's Tomorrow's Take !  Will Nifty Cross 24000 mark tomorrow?
Let's do this discussion in out stock market group
I am in Arun  Lets collaborate
Plz have this discussion in traders group
Yes. It will be given when one missed the class and with substantial reason for limited access.
"We can do that, starting with fundamental analysis"
Shall we send a request to them to give us access atleast to rewatch them once again?
We can.. but do we have so much time to rewatch sessions of 9 hrs?
"At least a few topics, we need to."
Maybe make 2 group as per interests - one for Trading and other one for Fundamental Research
"People can be part of all 3, but will be easier to track discussions"
Are bhai itne group nahi chahiye.. already bahot hai
"I do understand your concern , any suggestions?"
We already have two group..one is this one..other is for traders.. Creating one more group for those interested specifically in fundamentals
Can do fundamentals also over there
Person_48 bhai I also think so.. But u know there r people who only want this group for our course related stuff..
"So let all be happy  2/6/24, 11:48 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
I have pinned this group..this one is SPECIFICALLY for fundamental related stuff...
I agree for this group only for stuff related to course only. But in trading group we can discuss both Funda and tech
Do not make many groups..it's headache
There r people who hate the word 'trading' so let them have fun peacefully there..
Yes.. sab me NISM common rehega.. it will create more confusion
 certainly we can continue to discuss fundamental stuff in that group
So can change name of that group
But for those who only and only want fundamental..they can go to fundamental group
"I missed it, can anyone give me link for the technicals group?"
Person_42 sir almost completed 2 chapters of statistics today as per the Pdf shared by  sir Please correct me if i'm wrong because all the topics bounced from my head today
10000% true.. ma'am was not able finish even 1 chapter
I think we should talk to  ... Aise toh kuch samajh aayega nahi aage bhi
"Subject was not dat tuff,I feel it was not taught in a structured way. We as Non financial were not catching his pace"
"Please do not mind, but what also felt that, some of the questions asked by us also way out of topic and advanced discussion.....we should avoid it when they are just trying to teach us ABCD of the subjects"
For me I am still at ABCD stage of accounting and statistics
"very true, 50+ are non commerce, must try and make questions short at least (to the point and under 30 seconds), questions are helpful but it may eat into the time of the majority, and shorten lunch time as well"
"Ya when PPL start discussing advance level ,we get bored and demotivated ."
"It's great to hear from friends who know how to give perspective, appreciation that it can be done later when the relevant chapters come up would be helpful."
Buy Person_0 Books for CFA Lever 1. This is what I would recommend to anyone who is from non-commerce background
Correct this course borrows a lot from CFA Level 1
Both financial statement analysis and quant topics are exactly like CFA Level 1
"Non-commerce has a very good prospect with learning, since they do not have to unlearn and relearn. They start fresh from the course material and bring perspectives from their field of expertise to the market. Great opportunity to listen to their questions and views."
"I feel non commerce is not a problem for finance, mathematics is surely advantage. Statistics is based on formulas and it is worth if basic formulas are discussed or presented. Only theory may be difficult to understand without mathematical presentation"
In today's session there were only lines.. not even a single formula
I hope they do not expect us to write essay type answers without any sums
This will be night mare to write subjective instead of some practical take on
That is why I wanted to know their question pattern
We should more focus on quizzes than end term.. quiz will define our final Grade Point
//www.moneylife.in/article/sebi-penalises-kotak-amc-its-chief-nilesh-shah-and-5-other-officials-for-violation-of-rules/67628.html   The other day Person_21 rightly made an observation of the amount of restrictions imposed on Research Analysts and others. But guys like these are allowed to thrive after paying paltry fines.
Such people should be chucked out from the system. Hypocrites.
He works very hard to underperform savings bank rates
I am speaking about Person_52
"Someone was saying that in Research Analysts, cost of operation and production is more and income is hard in Research Analysts  So I didn’t understand that that day. I was thinking that 1. Get the certification Research Analysts 2. ⁠Start growing our clients and charge the fees  So where is cost of operation here ? Only income once certified .. Can run telegram group, Twitter etc …"
Is my understanding right ?  I am from non finance background so can please someone explain who has experience in Research Analysts
Exactly his little champ and other portfolio all are in negative.. Dont khow how he manages to get underperformed.
Tech overhead Marketing and sales over head Data maintenance for 5 years Subscription management Gst & it
You realise how bad things are the day you get license
You can charge one Client - 1.5 lakh per Annum  100 clients - 1.5 cr it is.. 1000 clients 15cr
Finding 100 people who can give 1.5 just for advisory is not easy in india
And that too to a new Research Analysts with no sm or tv presence
150 is the max limit of clients for Research Investment Analysts
"we can show our past portfolio performance and same thing we can show in advertisement on fb, insta, Twitter..  if that is allowed… I have seen people running telegram group with no certification having thousands people in paid group .."
"Man power , marketing, rentals, taxes"
one can give only the Research Analysts exam of nism and get regd as Research Analysts  with sebi. then what is the advantage of doing nism PGP-Research Analysts 15 month course and then getting regd as Research Analysts.  is there any difference between the two Research Analysts registration. 
without Research Investment Analysts license or any kind of regd with sebi you can do anything
No you have to pass sebi exam also with fee
Research Investment Analysts and Research Analysts are different right ?
We are here for Research Analysts research analyst
"So you are saying for Research Analysts certification, Research Investment Analysts is must ?"
one can start Research Analysts/Research Investment Analysts? Portfolio Management Services after this course
"In Research Investment Analysts, not Research Analysts"
There is no limit in Research Analysts
"I had this is why posted yesterday, either read a lot, or meet a lot"
"If you seriously want to be in this profession, networking is only way to do it."
What is the difference between Research Investment Analysts AND Research Analysts
Hope what was posted was not irrelevant to course
Nism PGP will only fulfill the educational criteria for Research Analysts
"If you are not an MBA or do not have previous experience  in any financial area, then u r not eligible to register with SEBI.   U can be certified by NiSM, but that is no sufficient to become SEBI registration if you are non mba no finance background"
"Read SEBI Research Analysts and Research Investment Analysts Regulations. I can tell you in 1 line, but it wont be fun"
Research Analysts Research Analyst  Investment Analysts - Investment Advisory PM - Portfolio Management Services 
Research Analysts and Research Investment Analysts are two different professions all together
"For portfolio management also , Sebi has stricter norms ..capital adequacy should be 2cr. Correct me if I am wrong"
Research Analysts can prepare research report and price target but cannot give  investment advises  Investment Analysts can give personalised  investment advises
what is the difference between Research Investment Analysts Vs PGP-Investment Analysts.  for being Research Investment Analysts we can directly give the exam (with the fees)
Portfolio Management Services net worth requirement has been revised to 5Cr now
"As per my best knowledge, minimum ticket size is 50L for clients to join you.   For you as a manager, need to disclose 5cr as networth."
No !  There are 3 specialization
You can opt one for this year
during the introduction of all of us someone said that he was already having his pms.  did not understand how that was possible.
Yes I’m here for Research Analysts
Is it true ?  ?  Can't we have advisory services on Research Analysts ?
IM GOING TO DO 3 Courses for 3 LICENSES   Portfolio Management Services Research Analysts Investment Analysts
"Yes, its true  you cant give investment advise as an Research Analysts"
But So Many People Give ! How is that? Can we say it as Illegal ?
"A research analyst can only sell his reports to clients. Person_25 advise them or influence them.   An investment advisor can advise his clients but cannot take positions for the client.  Under Portfolio Management Services, as a manager you may have full discretion as to what to do with clients money (ofcourse keeping under SEBI guidelines )"
"You are already Research Analysts, PM ,and Investment Analysts Person_5 !  It's just You need a piece of paper mentioned you are Registered"
*anyone can give advise as far as your are no violating SEBI rules*
In Zee business team most are Research Analysts.. They are recommending specific stocks.. So it should be allowed for Research Analysts otherwise they couldnt
Understand the difference   Ra : as per me sbi will go up  Person_57 : you should buy sbi
"Person_50 ,    is the best person to answer !as he is already a Research Analysts"
Maine already kharid diya hai. Ab aapko jo karna hai karo
Kunal saraogi... Giving specific recommendation on Zee business..what to buy with SL and target.. He is Research Analysts
 can you throw some light on this?
"If watching Zee Business Anil Sanghvi, also watch Person_16 CNBC"
There was an issue and Twitter fight that few TV panellist were not Sebi Registered and giving buy sell calls
Can Research Analysts do option trading ?
"Yes, Research Analysts can do Option Trading"
Trading to koi bhi kar sakta hai
Dont take the same trade 30 days prior or 5 days hence
As an Research Analysts The Advised Calls should not be taken by Himself ?
Ye Kaha Ka Nyah Hai Person_5 !
I would urge all to read Research Analysts Regulations updated 2023
Looks like   Giving weekly buy sell calls  And selling Far Month Options  Is the only solution
" bhai . i thought this pgp course is for full filling educational criteria,so PPL take admission here , I was surprised wen registered PPL r also n dis.Any specific reason?"
And Master Circular which was published on 21st May 2024
Sure I will   Thank you
I was surprised when asking questions here most people thought were irrelevant to course so now I keep silent and only asking limited questions 
"In Research Analysts community, most things I say are relevant"
Keep asking bro.. your que are most relevant one
It will be good if we are ready for that 
"Person_50, whatever the rules & regulations may be !  One thing is there, Be it Research Analysts , PM or Investment Analysts This Industry has a huge scope in the coming future ! ! Lets Give Our Best & Launch The Best Product For the People"
I am doing this course as I wanted to get a clear cut pass on qualifying criteria in case of inspection
"Which will happen, and does happen for all Research Analysts"
"If not today, 6 years from now"
Ya ground reality is not as we thought
Inspection can cost you between 5-15 lacs depending on queries raised
Can a Research Analysts sell mutual funds?
"Ao, better to have a clean book, degree"
"Research Analysts, if individual cannot earn from anywhere else"
"If corporate, has to give 5 lacs to take LLP or Pvt Ltd licence"
Then they can in individual capacity earn from other places
That's what I thought...i think even Investment Analysts cannot sell funds
"That is why I said, before attending lectures"
"  as you are already Research Analysts, I have three  questions … 1. Research Analysts certified can give or ask clients to buy sell options (equity and index ) as per research ?  As many Research Analysts certified are doing in telegram .. is it legal for Research Analysts ? 2. ⁠ Can charge fees  and give coaching or teach Share Market ? 3. ⁠if Research Analysts just provides research report then no client will buy that report .. clients want their capital to grow and if we don’t recommend shares to them then why would any client join Or subscribe you ?  Will appreciate a lot Pls answer in same format Thanks in advance … Others if have experience in Research Analysts can also pls answer… Many would have such questions… Thanks"
Are you registered as a corporate?
"1. Research Analysts certified can give or ask clients to buy sell options (equity and index ) as per research ?  As many Research Analysts certified are doing in telegram .. is it legal for Research Analysts ? *Yes, but you cant buy 30 days prior or 5 days after same series* 2. ⁠ Can charge fees  and give coaching or teach Share Market ? *Do it in different firm name. We all Research Analysts are already fighting SEBI on this to close shop of Finfluencers* 3. ⁠if Research Analysts just provides research report then no client will buy that report *that is ground reality*  clients want their capital to grow and if we don’t recommend shares to them then why would any client join Or subscribe you ? *report mein target, stoploss de sakte ho* "
 but for point 1..'connected persons' like parents brother wife..can buy same shares right? U simply have to give disclosures..isn't it?
The registered Research Analysts may not buy himself
But can ask his/her parents wife e.t.c to do it..
Isn't it how most registered Research Analysts are doing ?
"In compliance audit your CS will not ask, but in inspection, SEBI may"
"For SEBI, we are all thieves"
Ya but..we give it out as 'discloures' in our research report. Isn't it?
so even sebi should be fine if our parents.. or other 'connected persons' as per their definition buy stocks .. isnt it?
On one side SEBI is trying hard to regulate all this stuff. On other it isn't allowing Research Analysts to work independently
Anyone can teach not registration needed  Without* registration one cannot create community or give any buy sell calls  Many are teaching and providing buy sell calls in the name of mentorship which is illegal 
"Person_50, many of us will continue to have questions on this topic. May be we all can come on zoom on discuss this stuff. People already holding licences can help in understanding.    - possible for you to initiate it."
I can sometime in future arrange a call with my compliance person
In fact anybody can  Let's have a zoom session on this.. But most important is that  bhai should be available..   bhai..plz conduct a zoom session on this so that we can have a discussion over this stuff
My compliance person is best for this
One last question for the day   What do you mean buy one inspection can cost 5L ?
"She handles day to day compliance, not only of mine, of most Research Analysts"
"When SEBI does inspection on you, replying back and forth and contesting their claims can be costly"
All Research Analysts are fighting legal battle with SEBI to amend rules 
We are trying we should be one to educate only
Model pf is also grey area as of now
We Research Analysts are trying it should come to Research Analysts and now Investment Analysts
Smallcase a grey area as well? Most Smallcase portfolio managers are Research Analysts
Smallcase as of now is very selective on people it is onboarding
"Also, they are charging 5 lacs upfront fee"
I used to work their for 2 years
"So, have plans to open my smallcase soon once I have accumulated 5 lacs"
Registration feeez account me wapas kaise leyenge woh issue hai
They used to select random ppl
So we have to pay to earn?
You pay them upto 7% of Topline
And they give you a Telegram
Moat Research Analysts today are on Rigi
They now only have SEBI Regustered folks
"All other platforms, you will end up paying more than 12-20% of topline"
"Also, payment gateways mein its another battle to get registered"
But   what all does rigi takes care of
3.5 lakh nism ko do.. inta kam pad raha isiliye kamane ke liye 5 lakh or lagega
We’ll do a web catchup some time after class. I’ll answer all queries.
Person_60 wagle ... Registered Research Analysts.  giving stock advise ... also running advisory services.. charging around 20-40 thousand on several services.. also a member of zee business panel...
Pakka mai pehle he apko call karlunga have many questions
mentioning them.. because their activities are visible to us..
"People will do all sorts of stuff, including asking you to rent your license"
if they are openly doing it.. and not penalized by sebi as yet... it should be fine i think
And the consequences will be faced by Research Analysts?
I was approach to sell mine for 25k per month
"Yeah, big business this has become recently"
Specially the ones who are just registered
"Lol , how many people can u lend your licence?"
New Research Analysts are easily influenced
I got this story written instead
"Before even becoming an Research Analysts, know that we face multiple issues on a daily basis."
Person_40 meri samaj me jitna aaya usse yeh bol sakta hu ki Agar kamana hai Investment Analysts will be better choice than Research Analysts?
Investment Analysts OR Research Analysts ?? Person_59 BATAAO KYA LENA HAE MUJHE
Investment Analysts the business model itself is the challenge....no one in India pays a fee upfront for a financial plan...
Can we run a whatsapp group as Investment Analysts? 
Compliance wise  Research Analysts is best Then is Investment Analysts Then is Portfolio Management Services
I really was surprised when people were in first class thinking of doing dual specialisation and going for Investment Analysts. Most Investment Analysts and Portfolio Management Services managers are giving up licences and becoming Research Analysts
Person_44... woah.. He used to appear on that  nd sing songs with that SInghvi chap..
Article had to be written so young Research Analysts are not influenced by the likes of him
"After my experience with TCS, I stopped listening to any recommendation from Zee News.."
Scalability is there in Portfolio Management Services!
I was earning the most when I was at a corporate job
Portfolio Management Services ticket is 50 lacs
Which one can bring me bhar bhar ke money   I have to buy Lamborghini in next 5 Yesrs  
Your compliance cost will be 20 lacs per annum if I am right
That’s why mentioned that one can scale Portfolio Management Services to a higher absolute number as compared to the other 2
"Unless you are Person_53, Portfolio Management Services is tough business"
Yes. Compliance costs are very high in Portfolio Management Services
I that is why chose Research Analysts 
Portfolio Management Services is all about network!
Personally have worked with a few big names in the industry and thus decided for Portfolio Management Services over the other 2
"Also, I was wondering what are the regulations or requirements for a prop desk?"
Portfolio Management Services one needs deep pockets....its scalable once you hit a certain size and if you can build a good record..
 can you comment on this?
"Since it has got nothing to do with SEBI, one can do it freely right by registering as an NBFC?"
I have not explored a Prop Desk
Was earlier running my family office
"Personally, in terms of compliance, I know Research Analysts still have it easy"
What is Prop desk-- Can you guys elaborate little bit
I am happy we are all discussing real world questions
These all are relevant to your course
Publishing research reports on print media or anything else?
See an Research Analysts cannot give personalised advise
"But Research Analysts can give research reports, can give equal weighted basket"
And does not have to do risk profiling
Has to only take basic KYC Details
Research Investment Analysts also has to do Risk Profiling
"So in essence, I went for Research Analysts when starting my professional journey"
I hope this would help...there is a recent circular as well
Person_40 toh 1st class hua hai. Dont worry
"Bro , Please Try to attend offline classes! Excellent Knowledge, It will b sharing for us"
Will try to attend next week’s class if possible
As I will be in Mumbai
I will also try to join offline
Lets try for a weekend when max people can come   It would be great to meet you all in person.
weekends- we are in the class
I will be attending offline coming weekend
Person_3 PLEASE EVERYONE COME NEXT WEEK TO ATTEND THE CLASSES IN PERSON  WE CAN MEET ALSO  
I would like to join but not possible
Time is main concern for me
This guy is sebi registered Research Analysts  And running telegram group of 86000 people Giving options advise buy sell and as well as equity
Where is the sebi registration number ?
"Hey, does anyone has the soft copy of finance for non-finance and the statistics one??"
 what is the difference between *independent Research Analysts* and *Individual Research Analysts?*   There are two options when u try to register with SEBI as  Research Analysts.
Independent Research Analysts cannot do any other business
By any i mean not even earn outside stock market
But persons  life partner can make money out of market right ?
Outside  of stock market **
Can anyone tell all the books suggested plz? List will be helpful to download
So does it mean an AMFI Registered mutual fund distributor can call himself/herself an investment advisor ?? Does SEBI allow this ?
AMFI registered individual can sell MF only
"That person isn't an investment advisor, he/she is just mutual distributor only"
Individual Research Analysts can do under different entity as long as not related to stocks or MFs 
She is recommending stocks online on Twitter with disclaimer
Most of us want to do what Person_21i is doing. Sells plans on website and on telegram. Uses twitter for visibility and engagement. Ideal case to take inspiration from. 
When I started out 1 year ago I had 10 followers on Twitter
Content and Intent only gets followers unless we start engagement farming
Pls share your Twitter link here. We will subscribe for content
I had earlier shared. Someone asked me to delete
As of now we have 24k
Planning to hit 50k this year
"Hello, how can we check our attendance."
Received mail about this one. User id and password
What was the date and Subject of mail? I can't find in my inbox
"Hi, yesterday I received a call from NISM- regarding sending some documents over courier. Apparently we were informed of this through mail but it seems to have missed my notice. Can anyone tell me the documents that were requested by NISM?"
Received from sse With subject admission to PGP
Also of someone could help me with the date and subject of the mail
"Marksheets of 10th, 12th, graduation and post graduation matk sheet with degrees, experience certificate(2 set, self attested). 3 passport size photos."
Got it thanks. But I think attendance is not updated yet

Same. If anyone can share it .
This is his official personal meeting photos
"Hi, what are these photos and meeting.   Pls clarify."
Do we have any assignment to complete or anything from last 2 sessions? 
"Okay, thanks. And i wanted to check which is the site where we see our attendance..."
I am still not able to login to student portal . Anyone else facing the same issue?

For which portal we need to use this
This must be the prowess account
Can anyone help? Anyone facing this issue?

Person_9 and Person_63.... Thanks for helping on few doubts... Proud to be part of this grp
I missed first 2 days so creeping slowly
Don't worry.. you didn't missed anything difficult if you are from finance background
Hi Person_2. I have already registered but dint get a confirmation on account creation..
Attending Inperson Tomorrow ? OPTION: Yed (5 votes) OPTION: No (15 votes)
Tomorrow meeting Sadhav Shipping and Anlon founders
Unfortunately wont be able to attend
 I have a query how do you connect with these companies ?
"Has anyone watched ""Joy of stats"" by Hans Rosling sir mentioned... I couldn't find 1hr 48 mins video... I could see only 59 minutes video maximum"
1hr 48s was mentioned by mistake i think
Ok...or may be he meant 48 to 1 he video
i did watch the 59 mins one
"he was going too fast for the first class, maybe a tough day for him, all of us have those. The message i understood was to focus on the basics that he talks about and don't take too many notes. Communicated about the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics in a long duration. It's important to relax and figure with time. Tension nehi lena ka."
Ya u r right... I think it was supposed to be a simple introductory class..where he simply wanted to press upon the importance of stats... And wanted to touch simple basic aspects of it..like mean median e.t.c  But it turned into an advanced level class..with discussion on cluster sampling e.t.c
i think the afternoon session also makes us a lil drowsy
"cluster is also a simple concept like dividing into municipalities or schools, very simple when explained step by step"
very short time for lunch too
will have to keep rolls ready for Sunday
Will stick to the time as well!! Especially finishing
Weekend has been preponed to Fridays
they may start tracking video on at some point for attendance. best to keep on for 60% of time
Ya Person_32 god!..u saved us last Sunday.. we are hoping the same this Sunday too
Saturday 5.55 pm = Monday 9.30 am
16 pm on Sunday. Person_1 just texted me to confirm.
My home minister is far important that countries'
The lunch break is a lil too hard on ppl who have to cook their lunch also. Now 1 has to prepare breakfast and lunch together
"anyone who asks genuine questions after 9 pm on Saturday, 1 noon on Sunday or 5 pm on Sunday has to WhatsApp pay money to this group, for food, for the rest of us. Agreed?"
What time is the class today
So how much did they pay you for this ?
"//www.nism.ac.in/our_team/dr-dhiraj-jain) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnMPJoPmtzU - This video was suggested as an intro. ""Quantitative Investment Analysis (CFA Institute Investment Series) 3rd Edition Book"" seems to be the main textbook."
"//www.nism.ac.in/our_team/dr-latha-chari) Text book: Financial Accounting – A Managerial Emphasis – R Person_24Swamy, 7th Edition"
I think you have the perception of profession wrong
"What separates investors from analysts is we analysts make teams on Dream11 sitting at home seeing stats whereas investors actually have to play role of selectors and make real teams who will win or lose. Going out and meeting companies, we are able to bridge this gap to a decent extent. "
"That's a great approach, you are on a difficult, different but a correct path.   My best wishes to you in discovering the unseen.  I hope your experiential learning will help your batchmates here too."
"Person_21ji, please see if time permits to note down your interactions as a blog or you tube video, the library can grow over time and help pure research. It's hard to get reliable reading material, difficult to judge paid news. 8/6/24, 3:48 pm - SA: However, it's difficult to remain unbiased, assuming some information or edge not in public data can be extracted. Pertaining to below disclosure  Please note that no Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) is intended to be shared/ discussed during the interaction"
The real world is much different than what one assumes. Definition of Public information included
Public information is not equal to Published information.
But I would let all figure this out now
I am not that big of an analyst
"  Bro , I Honest Question! How Do You monetize On Research Publication? If not From Investing Or Trading ? Client Subscription Is it ? Or I am missing on something 8/6/24, 3:56 pm - SA: Don't we need to finfluencer first"
You can either be an analyst or investor
We are told to have client first approach
Person_46bhai webinar arrange kar sakte ho .. revenue vali baat pe?
"So, we may want to buy for ourself on a day like 4th June"
I really Missed Today's Visit To Mumbai!  Would have had a great Conversation with  !
We cant tell our clients to buy same stocks for next 30 days
"If anyone wants to catchup, I am today after 6 pm at Starbucks"
"Also meeting a promotor there, gonna grill him"
Other aspiring Research Analysts can come and sit
Is there any Body or a System Which Tracks ? Can also be bought from  Alternative Family Member Person_55 account?
I think it's pakda gaya wo chor
But I am not at liberty to say
Lol Class Starts At that time
We got an eye for that
*SEBI knows everything about everyone with a demat*
Multiply that 10x about you when  you have an ARN or INH
Is this aplicable for derivative market also
Mutual Fund Distributor Licence or Research Analysts/Research Investment Analysts License
"Once you start holding that, you are then under jurisdiction where SEBI can take official action against you for going wrong "
Your only details are tracked by SEBI
People have it all wrong and opposite
It’s crazy. How does SEBI expect more individuals to come forth and get registered. The whole payment gateway idea is just ludicrous!
 I'M COMING TO MEET YOU BROTHER-- I'm in your neighborhood  See you in BKC after class or before class  
Do you prefer 1 on 1 interactions or attending AGMs?
Both have their own learning and research value .....
"Research Analysts, Investment Analysts or PM what is your choice OPTION: Research Analysts (18 votes) OPTION: Investment Analysts (4 votes) OPTION: PM (5 votes) OPTION: Research Analysts + Investment Analysts (0 votes) OPTION: Research Analysts + PM (7 votes) OPTION: Investment Analysts + PM (1 vote) OPTION: All three (3 votes) OPTION: Yet to decide (10 votes)"
I find it ridiculous that a Investment Analysts cannot sell regular funds...Investment Analysts is technically MFD++
"I know a few people who are eligible to become Investment Analysts but are happy with being a MFD....this part I have not understood... 8/6/24, 4:56 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
"true sir, the trail from sip arn pays, paying for advice may take time to catch up. associations are sounding out sebi on this, hope more members from ia or ra are in their external advisory committee. committee members touch with ground reality takes painful years."
Yes true. In regular plans you might get more commission than the fee you could charge from an investor with a lot of efforts
"important to think through self cash flow projections, to decide whether to go alone, work for someone while building required funds or work with someone. Cash flow is key to peace of mind to observe in peace, have to delay the best of ideas many times."
Is parking place is available at NISM BKC pls confirm  who has visited during last session. as today will be my first day
"Hello everyone,  I'm traveling tomorrow evening so I'll not be able to attend the 2nd class.  Do i need to inform anyone in NISM.?"
Anyone having any idea on this.
Do i need to attach my traveling details also?
the purpose is to give unbiased advise. How would it be different than LIC uncles if they were able to sell funds. They would sell one with highest commission not the one which has the greatest benefit for client
In all and above to leverage any talent you need enough sales and negotiating skills for upscaling the business….
Almost everyone in my circle pays for fee only Research Investment Analysts instead of commision based products
The clientele who pays for Advisors have net investable value of 1cr and above. Which is not a very openly available clientele…
Is anyone from Navi Mumbai joining the classes live?
I missed the class last Sunday since I was travelling. What should I do?
"markets are relatively young, most clients are invested in real estate and gold, some may have had difficult experiences with shady dealers in the stock market. Therefore they stick with LIC uncles,  like you said sir, albeit 4% return as against 15%+ that you can deliver. Simple, but not easy. Uphill task, needs keeping at it."
"Log in today, first class of today's teacher. Previous class documents are in your mail. If missing, do comment will upload here. Was only basics and intro, you didn't much. "
These days I can’t seem to go to a bank branch where they don’t push ULIPs on me.
Whether it is SBI or HDFC.
"Seems like relationship managers at banks have a free rein on pushing any products, without properly explaining fees etc."
"rm ko bahut pressure he, daily morning review me. ulip, demat, gold coin sab. ulip me seller ka margin acha he."
"some pms give 5% fees, hard to resist from monthly Target perspective for rm. Eats into investor return later is ok,  rm would be in another bank."
"Money is pumped in the market like never before… JP Morgan, black rock, all pushed 2 trillions in last 3 quarters"
Person_3 IM GOING NISM EARLY TODAY DUE TO SOME OTHER WORK AS WELL  SEE YA SOON IN CLASSES
not really. i am talking about people with net worth of 20 lacs+. Its just that people are become more prudent about their finances. And ofcourse demography also matters. People with one cr+ go for Portfolio Management Services
"exactly, thats the reason, lof of people have been scammed."
"Yes it’s a bigger, scattered yet skeptical market… They prefer loosing money with half knowledge than giving it for advice and proper financial planning"
why would Research Investment Analysts give returns. They will ask questions to gauge your risk appetite and educate you accordingly. They are mandated to spend atleast 5 hr with each client. Their job is more to help you with your risk allocation and allocate accordingly. and help with your goals instead of helping you achieve above market returns
Is there any post class work for last class?   Or pre class for today’s class?
I havent met a single Research Investment Analysts who is focused on just higher returns. A lot of time they have to convince clients against this mentality and help them see that they cant digest as much risk as they think
"true sir, always good to keep an eye on asset allocation, whether the invested amount is 20 lakhs or more zeros. keep money away for personal milestone expenses coming up in the next 5 years in debt funds/ fd etc. That gives our money the ability to withstand equity volatility. The time to allow our personal projections to play out. "
no post class work for the last class. no pre class presentation received till now for today's. have you created nism.ac gmail and have received mails sir.
"I have logged in yes, nothing received for today. Just wanted to confirm"
"NISM series xII book, won’t it cover quantitative methods in securities market ?"
Almost 20% in ulip and 30%in traditional
"very difficult for clients too sir, they Google and see 70% 1 year returns in some funds. Sip inflow of 20k giving a floor, mutual funds forced to use algo and research to support is post buy documentation."
"34, in case logged before that"
"don't worry, will whatsapp you old presentation and docs in a few hours (not near laptop now)"
we have separate text book for that
101 (only for this course) Course Name: Overview of Securities Markets
completely agree. They arent the right kind of people who look for Research Investment Analysts. people are willing to lose 20K a month in market but cant pay 20k to Research Investment Analysts annually. Even though a lot of Research Investment Analysts also work pro bono and reduce fee for clients who cant afford them.
There are parking places at NISM office area. Outside parking
"Person_50, there are multiple books we have to read in this course. Isn’t there any single book which covers everything which we can go through and clear Research Analysts exam ?"
Won’t the PPT’s have most of the relevant content covered for each topic?
"yet, you keep learning and you will earn on your own, from the learning, in building your own capital. You are spending time on increasing your observation skills."
"that is the current understanding, quiz and internal assessment gives 50% marks, exams likely to be based on documents shared by the teacher. have to figure as we go."
ITS DONE Person_3  PLEASE CHECK.. LETS BE IN TOUCH PERSONALLY WITH EVERYONE AS NOBODY KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE NEXT BIG BULL FROM THIS GROUP
kya pata next big bull  mein hi ban jaaun
"Person_50, just said.. I read this line somewhere that  “you never know what you can become”.."
"nehi ji, hamare liye aap hi he, aj se ham ko aap BB he, Rajat nehi"
Jio mall near to class - 1 minute walk
How far is the mall from class?
Class starts at 6 today.. have you already reached ?
Laptop is not required for today's offline class??
Today is Saturday not Sunday…. And if your see under Saturday section it’s not mentioned And under Sunday section only it’s mentioned .
Hmmm  baat to sahi Kahi
Heheh koi nahi.. so laptop not required for today..
But then that's what the MFDs do without any regulation....my point is why this freedom to a less qualified guy...
"Its not about freedom, earlier as a customer you didn't have a choice, now you have it."
"I have a theory,   So there are just 3000 (Investment Analysts, Research Analysts and PM) in India. They cannot impose super high level regulations with an army of just 3000 officers, However, the Soldiers (Brokers) are the Front liners to cater to the 15cr Dmats.  So in order to impose heavy regulation to Brokers, they need to expand the (Investment Analysts, Research Analysts, PM) work force first. Let's say when it reaches from 3000 to 30,000. It becomes easier to impose heavy regulations.  Till the time that number is reached, it becomes rather difficult and unsustainable for Investment Analysts,Research Analysts,PM to do profitable business.  I am glad to hear what you guys think about this matter."
"I think Mr Register sir has pointed out in first class that, SEBI current concentration is regulating the intermediaries to protect the  investors not the investor itself. So, once we register ourselves, we become intermediaries .  Baki,  influencer bageda still investor and unregistered intermediaries.  But, I think, in future they needed to be tackled first.  India mein sabko free mein chahiye. Ration, electricity, medical etc. So, people don't want to spend anything on Research Analysts OR Investment Analysts guys.  Everyday, well educated crorepatis are scammed for higher returns. Sometimes, I find it hard to believe the numbers , how come IT professionals etc are falling into these traps."
"Financial education is not proportional to your paychecks or professional roles. People in general have no idea what the rat-race is, the consumer trap is, all worry about the peer pressure and try to get validation from their peers and purchase a BWMs and do a Euro trip, instead of investing and compounding."
"I m talking about educated people transfer Lakhs to cr of rupees for unimaginable profit promises. If someone ask me to transfer money to five different accounts, that should  be a big red flag. But, people are doing it or all the news are fake."
Same with the Crypto and NFT scams. All millionaires got scammed by the Big Whales and billionaires.
"All want quick money, no one wants good old school warren Person_43 like Investment and compounding over 20 years."
"Yes exactly....Big whales ne bhi scam Kiya toh acha lagta hain... They are being scammed by uneducated Indians & Bangladeshi, sitting in Myanmar"
I'm at shop having tea come and join
"Bruv, did you time travel into the future?  today's 8th. Next time don't take the jio malls route."
I will also try to join next class  offline
Requesting everyone to join in on behalf of the coordinator.
Why does it say June 9 on the bash-board?
I Still Don't Have Clarity On Research Analysts and Investment Analysts !  When Research Analysts Can Only Publish ! We See lots of Research Analysts In The Market Giving Recommendations! Do We Say They Are Doing Illegal Or Non Regulated ?
Someone Can Ask This As There is a lot of Overlapping
My Question - So where does Research Analysts fits in?  Answer - He can only write reports for companies.  nahi samajh aaya
Write and Publish !  I was wondering how he will monetize ! Because nobody is bothered to read a publication! All they news is Ready Made Recommendations
Just like Credit Rating Agency. Publish good research report about companies and earn from them..
I knew the people who were involved in one captial insider trading
This is his first class right ?
I mean first class on capital market ?
But you need to keep record
Basically Research Analysts can give their analysis which is same for all client Whereas an Investment Analysts can give personalised investment advise to client based on their risk and goals  Giving recommendations is ok for Research Analysts unless they are not giving recommendations on a personalised level to client based on their requirements
"Investment Analysts have individual clients, like I will approach an Investment Analysts and ask him to make a financial plan with for me. He will ask me some data like what are my liabilities, assets, investments etc to do risk profiling. Then he will sign an agreement with me and conduct few sessions. And help me build a financial plan based on my goals. he wont invest on my behalf but will tell me where to invest. His advise is personalised to my goals and risk profile and cant be genralised"
Also Investment Analysts are not stock specific and cover all asset classes.
This means Investment Analysts is most suitable for entry level
As Portfolio Management Services caters to bigger clients and Research Analysts ka to Pata hi nahi chal raha ki karta kya hai
this will suit to all sort of clients including people who arent investing in stock markets. But they have to pay you a fixed fee. That fixed fee also works as a guarantee that you are not baising your advice in favour  a specific instrument. and have their best interests at heart.  So no commision for the products you suggest.
Research Investment Analysts's are facing a lot of regulatory restrictions as compared to Portfolio Management Services providers
"yes, this is becoming tough for individuals who are Research Investment Analysts. cant say as compared to Portfolio Management Services as Portfolio Management Services would usually have the resources to follow the compliances. Most Research Investment Analysts are individuals instead of being institutions and hence difficult for them to follow"
How I see it...following all regulations 100% in letter and spirit may not be possible.. One needs to find ways out of it..making sure that u do not get in the net...
"As an Research Analysts, you can create a customized report based on the client's investment requirement.  You will not publish it in public. The client, probably an HNI, pay you for it.  There are research analysts in fund houses. You will never see their reports in public. Those are internal. In that case, you work as an employee in the fund house."
"I m product manager for Person_57 product, the most difficult part is product promotions, we can't really showcase the returns anywhere plus for any other advertisements we have to show the BASL advertisement approval numbers There's AResearch Investment Analysts, BASL , SEBI behind Research Investment Analysts with theirs own rules"
Portfolio Management Services is way better
working for Finology? Also why would you showcase the returns? when it is customised for individuals. You arent investing on their behalf right
"Research Investment Analysts can either release their model portfolio like on Smallcase, Pick right etc or they can be advisors on personal level, personal advisors are better because they can have individual client relationship"
"And Is there any restriction for  Portfolio managers on which financial instrument to trade ?  Or one can trade any Derivatives, Equity Etc"
I think there are no restrictions.
"can use derivatives for hedging and rebalancing, given it is stated in agreement with client and derivative exposure does not exceed portfolio value. - do check out on sebi site"
Most startups and fintech dont know this basic math
only listed equity & debt for discretionary pms
Just seen an ad about copartner. They will try to connect Research Analysts and trader to improve trading of trader.
Hii I had to leave the meeting at 8:30 due to some reason so may i know if sir had given any assignment or is there anything important that i missed ?
GOOD MORNING Person_3 ITS Research AnalystsINING IN MUMBAI
Can someone tell me the books Latha mam was talking about?
We need to get prowess subscription activated?
How do we access last week  recordings ?
Why can't they always share presentations in advance?
"That's the only way, giving your reason"
I don't mind it even if it's 5 minutes before the lecture
Anyone who is attending the class in person I request you to please convey it to  ji
"Note that there are NO CLASSES on Jun 15 & 16, 2024 hence you may plan your weekend accordingly.   We will mention it in the Jun 22 & 23, 2024 class schedule as well. Refer to the academic calendar.  -   (in Zoom Chat)"
 One of the participants is asking for WhatsApp link! Please share with him  Unable to find the link myself otherwise would’ve forwarded
"Person_12, He is asking for WhatsApp link to join this WhatsApp group"
Person_45 ko NISM online mentor banaya jaaye
But he never reply to gareeb students questions 
Sharing the certification textbooks available on the link shared by Mr. 
"Hi All, please ask for recordings in zoom chat.. You can reply over my message in zoom chat … if more people ask, chances are high …"
You brother ..our honourable technical analyst
I have replied to all questions posted till now
Woh alag baat hai I have not attended

Anyone has a paid subscription to screener
What are the added features/ benefits
My friend Person_8 prepared a very good chart 
I am in touch with Person_31 ji and Dr Person_36 ji also

I am busy tomorrow and leaving tomorrow
Mostly may get free around 9 pm
Basis ppl location can be decided ofcourse
What time 2nd session will be starting 
What is Investment Advisor Level 1  And Investment Advisor Level 2 ? Just for my understanding!
Investment advisor level -1 is basic Investment advisor level -2 is advance
For getting a licence do we have to clear both ?
"Person_50 if I screen record the session from my mac , will it capture the voice also ?"
Never tried and also new to mac  so just asking
You can't record it unless admin change the setting to public 
if we do PGP-Investment Analysts then we are Investment Analysts1 or Investment Analysts2?
Does anyone have soft version of this book?
Sending this screenshot to    I am sure He will then agree to share recording..
Stoked up your biting before joining next session as Person_39 Bharat is arriving and will be departed after 2 pm
But screen recording is not viable
"When you start recording, it will send a message to the host ( sir) that xyz participant has started recording"
Hope that doesn’t get you flagged or something  Might be against the course guidelines and regulations
"Investment Analysts 1&2 both are similar only, since the syllabus is vast they divided into two parts"
I tried..but that option has been disabled by respected  
He will not get any notification for screen recording
Risk Hai Toh Ishq Hai… Just Joking. Dont break rules folks
"As per my best knowledge, I guess it will! But still not 100% sure"
This are certifications exams that the Investment Analysts have to clear in order to run their business
Statistics class should be in the first half infact
Only video is possible what will you do about the audio part
In second half..that too after lunch..that too by dhiraj sir...given his speed..is a challenging task
  try screen recording bro and check if it catches the audio also
I can club it with screen recording
are you really going to listen to a 3 hr recording?
just jot down the terms and google them later?
Hii everyone I have taken a leave because I'm traveling rn.. Can anyone please let me know if any assignment is given in FSA today ? Got the mail of today's content and it has worksheets attached..Please kindly help
"no assignment other than generally reading any company financials from the web, to familiarise yourself with terms. The excel will be used in next class."
The discussion we are having right now..is going to increase vande Bharat speed by atleast 200 kmph near the end of the session 
This lecture is very boring !!
I want to start discussion on Mumbai rains
Ya plz!..i am sure sir will have some statistics..and associated documentary on that subject too
I think actual presentation has not even started yet
I can see a smile of ur face  sir
It's risky..he will start having inferential statistics and blah blah stuff
the faculty loves to discuss the topics but he veers away from the actual topic
Stats padhna hai to study 10/11/12 Stats
Ek good idea lag jaata gai of basic concepts
The Wolf of Wall Street The Wizard of Lies Rogue Trader Boom Bust Boom Margin Call Gafla The Big Short Billions Scam 1992 Wall Street Inside Job Boiler Room Money Monster Arbitrage The Pursuit of happiness Billions Bazaar Money Big bull Dumb money Equity Barbarians Boom bust boom Trading places Too Big to Fail

Trying to push us into deep
"ye commerce main tha, dont think it was there in science"
"ca foundation ka padhlenge bhai toh bhi kaafi hai, hafte mein seekh lenge "
Person_40 bhhi hai kya foundation mein stats

"Only while starting the class, not while ending"
"This on going lecture is party of 101,102 or 103 ?"
"Who said  ""Skip this chapter sir """
That's was me in sleepy mode
what I learnt today? that standard deviation also has a standard deviation
may be in next advanced class I will come to know that the standard deviation of the standard deviation also has a standard deviation.....and so on....  
 the first book  ..the chapters marked are from that book only
Kindly share the link to buy the cfa book
I am also searching this book is out of stock in Amazon
Kindly share when anyone gets it
Professor started hitting us all round the park now...
"""Story toh aapko draw karni hai.."""
I guess the missing is practical use... May be i m making early comment
Lines said by Every promoter to analyst
"questions are making our teacher negatively skewed, are we that mean"
Ya..it means..he is becoming 'so mean' now.. And turning on the 'beast MODE'
can there be any distortion of the standard deviation of the standard deviation of the skew of the kurtosis of the mean of the standard error of the corelation of the variance of the mode divided by the median? ?  
Pura session skewness me nikal gaya
"Person_50, no QnA for this class please. Let’s not stretch it beyond 5"
"I tried to poke him,,, but didnt get expected answer"
Tumhare 5 saal ke trading ke career me Person_33 Kaam Aya Hai kya ye Skews ?
Most of the members sleeping with camera off
 sir keeps his camera off.. who knows if he’s also dozed off
sabko bell curve ghusana hai iss mein
Yeah sab thik hai.. skewness market me kaise use karna hai?
15 min se bol raha hai.. it resembles but not exactly representative of bell curve
I seriously Want to know !
"Gentle reminder it is fag end of the class,  1715 all close"
"I just remembered a song  ""nism hame kis MODE pe le aaya"""
"I missed first day,,, doesn't look I missed anything"
Now I will attend every class in person  From home it's totally frustrating and not able to focus & feel like let's sleep during the lecture  Offline class is best
ke dil kare hai.. koi humein samjhaye.. skewness kya hoga
At off line we can have power nap
SKEWNESS !  I'll never ever forget this word my entire life
Person_40 week end chalu hoga... Until tomorrow 8
Ab lag raha Hai kyu poocha... lamba ho jayega session
Likhenge kya? That we have 95% confidence that we will not get passing marks?
I feel we didn't use median correctly here 
To check mean we need to sort data first
But here we just went by nifty closing value per month
mean is just average. why would you need to sort data
There r only 2 type of people in this class.. 1) those who know more than sir 2) those who don't know anything It's really skewed
"I am really worried if someone asks "" sir can you please repeat one more time"""
for median you need sorted data. for mean you dont
"I am wondering,  Are we really using all these in Trading?"
after this you will do algo and hft. you are being prepared for a higher purpose.
"10, any one asking questions from now are going to be skewed! pakka!"
10 ho gaya .. Ho gayi draw.. STORY
We Can Also Get A Readymade Data and Graph ;
people does someone know what is normal and gaussian distribution. google gives a lot of jargons
"If anyone has noted today's concept points for Stats, please share"
"sirne bola, i am stopping here"
"normal distribution is like a bell, with graph symmetric on both sides "
bas simple bell curve hai na. why so complicated words then?
He is in rush than us
"sir said ""statistics ki koi limit nahi hai"""
 Hats of to you bro. ! We Are Scratching our heads to understand and you have So many questions! And Sir couldn't answer your questions!
"By Jun 14, 2024 one of you please email the names of Class Representatives (CRs) to me. Let's have 2 participants preferably from each specialization PM, Investment Analysts & Research Analysts to begin with and proceed further. CRs will be point of contact between NISM & the entire batch. - Shri  G  2 persons from each stream are requested to name themselves please  "
 god...there are petty people like us in the class.. Requesting u to plz consider our lack of knowledge
Do we need to create this group from our end or  sir will create this wp groups.?
" ji kindly pin this, we are to reply before 14th June"
Lets do this after 11th .by that time more mates will be clear about what they are going to choose
"Let's try to make up our mind about choosing the stream(Investment Analysts/Research Analysts/Portfolio Management Services).. After 11th let's finalize CRs also  By that time more people will be clear about their streams  9/6/24, 10:00 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
Enjoy the rest of Sunday without any standard deviation!
  For Investment Advisor Do We have to clear both Level 1 & level 2 ?
 bhai..plz come back to trimester 1..u r in trimester 3
We will need to take separate stats classes from u on weekdays
He has finished 2 lectures today also
"Actually Sir used a little wrong vocabulary for the situation -  *""One Level Ahead""*  Instead it was  *""One level Deeper""*  of the same topic, would be accurate."
We All Have To Get-together One Day !  What Say ! We Should Know Each Other In Person !
Yes that's a great idea. All future PM and Research Analysts meet-up
Any DS (Data Scientists) in the group?
Let's fix a date and attend offline class in Mumbai..as many batch mates as possible..
All Bangaloreans up for Coffee and Dosa meetup??
So Good To Hear !  All Future Ra & PMs
On that note Rameshwaram is not a Bangalore product or brand 
Wait I have one better.  How about -  All future Faces of SEBI.
Lets Decode On Location! Date we can decide later Upon everyones Convenience! OPTION: Mumbai (7 votes) OPTION: Bangalore (9 votes) OPTION: Goa (1 vote) OPTION: Pune (3 votes)
"I missed that voting of Ra, pms, ia... I assumed that's how we choose stream, right? Or it's just informally collected data"
Let's see if we see any Skewness in this poll graph.  
Voting has not yet started!  We have time till 11 june to decide
This Is What I Read in the group !
Not for deciding upon choosing ra ia e.t.c
On 12th let's have a poll on this..
We have ample time to choose ia ra pms course
I think they will give us a form
For every specialisation we would need 1 person to volunteer for the CR role.
Bro You Can Be CR for All Three !
Person_46 and Person_26 should also be considered.
"Naah man, I am not gonna volunteer for the CR."
You Are Already a CR Bro
Instead what I would suggest is that We all need a separate career guidance class. To  understand about all licences and scopes and best practices within NISM and SEBI. What say? 
+1  Yes ! We Need To !
It should be before deciding to go for ra.pms.ia
Yes exactly. Else we all will be caught in hindsight.
Future CRs please take this matter up with Person_11.
And you are one of them
Is some one from Kolkata ?
"From what I Know. Few pointer about all three.  *Research Analysts* - Can practice independently or with an org. Can publish research reports. Can work with firms. Not sure about advice on social media. Experience Requirements are pretty lax for non finance folks.  *Investment Analysts* - Can give personalized advice for financial planning to individuals. Help makes financial plans and helps people with their financial goals. Core objective -  help communities and general folks.   Need prior experience of 5 yrs in financial advisory field.  Can be independent or get an institutional license. Capital adequacy requirements are higher for institutions.   *Portfolio Management Services* - Only institutional, can manage capital for others. Min portfolio size if 50 lakhs Min net worth should be 5 cr.  Prior experience of 5 years in wealth management.  So if you dont have that kind of capital or experience doesnt make sense, same goes of Research Investment Analysts in case of experience.  Requirements can be seen on sebi website."
"Para 5,6,7 in the about talks about qualifications. One can read completely for detailed"
1. what is the exact meaning of net worth of 5 cr. does it mean 5 cr of bank balance/FDs? 2. what is the exact meaning of 5 yrs experience in wealth management. unless sebi gives registration as pms manger how can one be in wealth management.? 
"1. Net worth includes everything you own, including your house. need not be only cash. 2.  Sad state of affairs. makes it too hard for people to get into the field. Usually it means even if you were an employee of a Portfolio Management Services that counts, bank manager or anyone in financial space it counts. What they mean is you shouldn't be a noob.  Correction - it is 2 yrs. Not 5. *an  experience  of  at  least  two years  in  related  activities in  the  securities  market including in a portfolio manager, stock broker, investment advisor or as a fund manager* as mentioned under para 7."
"usually you need to go to a CA, who grants you net worth certificate"
"Explanation. For  the  purposes  of  this  regulation,  ""networth""  means  the  aggregate  value  of paid up equity capital plus free reserves (excluding reserves created out of revaluation) reduced by the aggregate value of accumulated losses and deferred expenditure not written off, including miscellaneous expenses not written off."
I appreciate your prompt reply. also wanted to know if managing my own money in stock market (and that of few relatives ) be considered as experience in wealth management.?  many of us are from non financial backgrounds. we are working in our own professions then overcoming that clause is a hurdle?
"i agree, I am in same boat."
"I believe, getting a Portfolio Management Services license is hardest"
What Is Considered As Experience In Wealth Management?
you can appoint a team with required experience and certifications sir
Many Of Us Are Here For The Same
We have to get this clarified with Professors
" - bhai are you hiring, please hire me.."
Also a capping of min amount is also a big hurdle
Person_19 Is The best person to ask
"working in the buy side or sell side research, stock broking, mutual fund, pms and other sebi registered equity market activity is relevant experience"
better to meet the concerned people in person to clarify.    maybe I can start as Investment Analysts for 2 yrs then apply for PM. I am planning to do both PM and Investment Analysts certification
For Investment Analysts also you need to have experience
Yes We Have To Plan !
"i spoke to one of the Investment Analysts, they suggested to get a mutual fund distributor license and use that as experience"
"after two years, you will be eligible for Investment Analysts"
Research Analysts's can also be considered as Experience Right ?
One can use.. I had license for Mutual fund distributor for this purpose
I HAVE 7 YEARS OF WORK EXPERIENCE IN BANKING AND FINANCE- RETAIL LOANS  AM I ELIGIBLE AS PER THE WORK EXPERIENCE CONCERNED?  HAVE WORKED WITH ALMOST ALL TOP BANKS 
How do you procure that ?
how difficult was to get this. and how tough is teh exam
"yes sir, ra / ia too"
"Then !  May be First We Have To Attempt Research Analysts , Then Investment Analysts ! Then PM"
this seems to be the way
Clear Nism exam for Mutual funds  distribution. After this you can get your self registered with AMFI to get ARN number. After getting arn one can sell mfs
EVERYONE COME TO THE CLASS PLEASE  LETS MEET IN PERSON
we should ask nism faculty to elaborate on this as it will help us to select between Research Analysts/Investment Analysts/PM
Not that difficult. You can subscribe pass4sure web site for shortcut. For proper knowledge you can download study material from nism website
"With a Research Analysts Licence,  If we start our own company! That is also considered as Experience Right ?"
Yup.. easier than to understand skewness
Website for preparation of all NISM exams. You can do practice over here.
Thay have very limited mock test
Pass4sure is better for mock tests
Better to prepare from nism material. It is very helpful while selling mfs
"This course that we are doing will help those who do not have post graduation in finance.  For those who have post graduation in finance as well as those completing this course, Nism relevant certifications are required separately as per sebi.  What stream to choose is judgement on interest, client revenue and capital currently available."
As we discussed earlier it is easy to monetize as Research Analysts than other ones. Am I right  ?
As per my understanding start with Research Analysts and mfd.  Get 5 years of experience and than go for other ones.
2 years exp is what they Ask Right ?
Or For Experience We Can Get Experience Certificate From   !
"Just holding Mutual fund license is enough? Or we should work as a distributor?   Nowadays, people can buy direct ones from platforms lije zerodha/coin. They are not dependent on MF distributors any more"
Holding arn means selling on paper. If you want to sell or not it's depends upon you
By selling mfs you can generate revenue
You will get about 0.5-1% of AUM as commission
you can also reverse work from what you earn from 1 client to arrive at corpus required to meet your desired level of income. How achievable does that corpus look in a desired time.
1) No experience is required anywhere for those who are in the batch of this PGP or MBA-Finance related fields or Qualified accountancy or finance.  2) For raising licence for individual minimum networth is 1 lakh. Or license against a company min. Network of 50L on company's account.
For mfd by managing 1cr of AUM one can earn around 25k per month
I am asking about net worth
"Additionally, in case of Investment Analysts executive MBA courses for less than 2 years would not be considered as qualifications."
Either 5 year work ex with bachelor degree   Or  PG degree/diploma in Finance  or  PGP NISM   Any 1 satisfies the qualification norms.
For Research Analysts... For Investment Analysts relevant work ex is also required
This Of For Research Analysts Right ?
As per the guidelines. No work ex is required for us at NISM. This batch.
"Dr Person_6 madam took an intro session 2 months ago, she confirmed the same.   Still I have loads of questions about the scope of work profile.  What is on limits and off limits."
No idea about this intro session.
Lets Put Up Some Important Questions and Let One Person Mail to Dr Person_6 ma'am !
Let's try to have a zoom session with baid maem
Let's wait until announcement of CR
Or someone competent to answer our queries
Or someone who has complete know-how of the matter
"Exact factual details about eligibility criteria, qualification, capital requirements e.t.x"
Most imp how to recover NISM fees ?
I am pretty sure about this.
Agree with you. Post graduation diploma must be more than a year. Below that won't be considered
You sure. Good news if it is true. But where is it mentioned?
I am pretty sure relevant work ex. Is required for investment advisor
"Or NISM, this course is the qualifier, that why director sir called us the face of SEBI in our induction class. Caz we all qualified. Probably all will get a license unless some serious fishy stuff is caught during the background check process."
I remember in intro session they said more like no guarantees. And washed their hands off.
Jabse group form hua hai tabse yeh ek hi baat pe discussion chal raha hai..  .. jitna discussion ho raha hai utna confusion badh raha hai
They just said this is a prerequisite as one of the qualifications. But never waived off the requirements for experience.
"Person_5, read the regulations, everything will be clear"
Have read through it. It's same right
As per my knowledge a registered Research Analysts can not hold mf distribution licence.    Need to confirm this also
2 years Work Exp is Needed
But as an Research Analysts why do u want mf license?
Because of all the confusion I have decided to take each and every specialisation one after the other. First Research Analysts then PM and last Investment Analysts
I think tarang has mf licence .
Before Deciding On What specialization To Choose !  We Should Know All The Details To obtain each one of them !
"This is the right approach,but I feel Research Analysts then Investment Analysts and finally PM. Anyone with more Gyan can throw some more light."
I was about to say this
Good part is that NISM supports this as given in PGP brochure.
I think We have To Decide on CR !  And Let The CR Take The Queries to the concerned person ! We All Can Draft the Queries together
And really surprised to see we have only 1210 research analysts (sebi registered)!! Why is it so.. The qualification does not seem to be difficult. NISM certification is not tough
Because people don't want to get entangled in compliances and regulations..
This Will Take Lots of time !  1.5 Years  X 3 special ! 4.5 years
I am myself managing Account of 7 friends and family..no license..nothing..
But as sebi is getting strict..
I thought to grab the license
When u manage friends and family account! Not an issue at all ! But for you to grow ! You need a lot more accounts and Funds !
"No, once you have Research Analysts, you are exempted the first trimester and certain portion of second trimester."
The minimum account size is 25 lakhs which I am managing..
My own account size is 55 lakhs..
"Yes , but we can attend only during the specialization semester!  We can't jump !"
But ya..to convince an unknown person..license should help
Sone agencies told me it is not easy to get. They will reject the applications on random reasons. SEBI may want to have some restrictions on this deliberately
It is another story how much people will get convinced after the license
"Yes, you can not jump,  that time will have to be invested ."
"But again, is that legal as per SEBI. That is the problem no"
Both are diff one.. but still need clarification
"More than Convincing, It's for safety ! If somthing goes wrong. ! With licence You are always under the law"
If u know how to work things up..everything is doable..
How many of u know that u can claim operator expenses on the money earned from market?
And u can get tax exemption on it?
Does managing own account count as experience.
I claimed 8 lakh as operator expenses last year..doing it since 6 years..
Yes when did as a Company
Create A LLP !  Become a director in the company and Give yourself as Fund Manager
u cannot have a specific Company to trade in stocks..I also have a company(director in 1)..
U need nbfc license..if ur company is only into trading
As the fund is your own !
"Yesterday sir talked about ""playing with stocks"",  computer systems etc.  Everything can be tracked and found out.  He even mentioned finding the pattern.   So there are systems which will be enhanced to find out things in the future.  Multiple persons using the same IP is an en example"
 Has One ! He Does The Same !  Isn't it ?
And using same IP is no issue..
U cannot stop people from trading just because they have same ip
Yeah.. probably. I just mentioned that the data can provide traces if needed. That's all
"Person_50 can we please keep the message frequency in the group little low and confined, it's really hard to keep up with all the chatter bombs"
Thanks … will do this then…
"86 participants , Exciting Career & A Sunday !  What Can Be Expected!"
dr.baid ma'am had clarified that if anyone wants to do all 3 specializations then it has to be in continuity.  one cannot take a gap in between.  I had asked dhiren sir in our intro 1st session. he had said that we will be getting email intimations about it at correct time. we should be on the lookout for that.
 We feel the same with ur stats bombs in dhiraj jain sir's class bhai
one observation about our group from the intros I heard in 1st session. all group is having above average intelligence and lot of enthusiasm. we should all meet so we can bond more as a student team. feels great and previledge to be part of you all.  Dr. Person_37 pune
I agree with u 100 percent sir!.. We have complete mix of wisdom..
A Sunday class (physical) followed by a get together? so that people from other places plan in advance?
Right guys!..let's plan for it some time
Plz inform in advance so I can book tickets accordingly  as it will take more than 14 hours to reach Mumbai from my place
I am also in but plan it in advance
"Great, I am currently based at Pune too, how many more from Pune.   If there are sufficient batch mates, we can plan and have one class in a month physically at BKC. It will give us some space and time to Interact, network and learn."
I feel Catching Up In Mumbai Will Be Better
We All Can Attend One Class Together!  If a large Gathering! They might consider conducting classes in Patalganga Campus
Lets Decide On One Date !  Where we all will attend
"Yes we all can try at least one Sunday in a month for physical class 10/6/24, 10:56 am - SA: Bajpaji Sir, your query on pytorch tensor basically multidimensional array representation wasn't answered in class.  My understanding is It's a float data structure so you can store interval data.  But you may ask word2vec and LLMs chatgpt how does it uses words which can be classified as a categorical data into tensors ( if I understood you correctly). Basically each word becomes a high dimensional vector.  I think I shd stop now before it get too complex"
Not legal....but then SEBI will never know...issue can only happen if someone complains...there is no legal way to manage other person's money without a license...
"So, as an AI Scientist, we get the input data set tensor in the form of *Pandas*  which is usually prepared by a separate team.  This is the work flow -->  1)Team of Statisticians collect the data and do ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) loading the data cubes -->  2)Team of DS Preprocess the Data into usable Data structure libraries like Pandas (Tensors) -->  3)Team of AI Scientists will design a Deep Neural Network model (CNN, LSTM etc depending on the problem type) they train the model and test it.   From the point Statistician prepares data ,  transform it into data cubes and load it, we really lose the sense of what the original form of the data is really.  Sir being a hardcore statistician might know about this problem, Caz after transformation you can change the type of data. FP32 and INT8 are just the internal data types they can store respective values but it's the data preparation, Extraction and transformations process which actually changes the nature of the data.  I think we will discuss this in great depth when we start Inference based Statistics.  10/6/24, 11:45 am - SA: Bajpai sir amazing summarisation"
Kindly find NISM referred books on CFA- Quantitative Analysis and Statistics  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P4_vkHLla5K-1V_WV7osyOQ04TRVJbbJ?usp=sharing
I guess Financial Statement Analysis book is also available 
"Yes , Both Financial Statement Analysis & QA"
"It's there in Module 7. Linear regression models.  It's getting harder and harder these days to call ourselves Quants if we can't do Inference modelling. Most portfolio managers and mutual funds use their own Quant inferencing algorithms using Deep learning AI (LSTM, Time series) models."
Bro you are pro  We are noob .. baksh do hame
Mean Median Mode mein hi logon ki neend udd rahi hai
PM's Do Quant Based Trading ?
I understood all these things. But how to use practically that's the problem?
Story tho aapko khud ko likhni hai !
"Not trading exactly, they use it for rebalancing their portfolios using AI model classifications."
Ohh ! We have people who define and design the Setup According to our strategies right ? I mean readymade
I really need to know !
To learn all these things need to do another course for programming?
"But that's just a technical indicator or a combination of technical indicators automated with your strategies, that's not a real AI inference model."
"Haha ! I would Love to learn this !  I Have seen people who do swing trading just by not doing anything! ! Whenever I ask them they say AI , And Don't disclose how  or allow me to visit their office"
Then what is AI Inference Model ?
So many algo traders using AI. But for AI emotion of market is missing.
Some US based traders use it. Most Indian ones are just simple automation scripts.
And they book 10-15% every month easily
"Let's not focus on trading here, instead we must focus on equity research, portfolio rebalancing for long term investment."
"But for a PM ,  Swing trade and rebalancing, Automated scripts are more than enough right ? Or do we have to dig into Quant & AI"
Damn !  I'll have to get serious about this then
Best Quantitative Trading Strategies 2024 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quantitative-trading-strategies-quantifiedstrategies-iqolf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&utm_campaign=share_via
Better we 1st get basics of equity research and PM straight (get the domain knowledge) and NISM is one of the best place just for that after NYIF.   Then we can formulate our own research and AI models.
What NYIF? New your institute of finance
Yeah if you are inclined towards CFA then NYIF is your high temple.
"Arre Bro ,  Itni dhoor jaana nahi hai !"
You shared the CFA material. I thought u were already preparing for it.
Don't they have courses on Investment Banking.. I am not sure but it must be quite expensive
Yeah just for secondary markets. It's like NSE-Academy for NSE same is NYIF for NYSE. For IB and PE you can try IIM-Calcutta executive MBA courses they have good IB batch.
On A Lighter Note !  Stars Of NISM PGP !  Week 1 :  Week 2 :  Week 3 :  ???????
Hum tho Back Benchers hai bhai
"No star man, just a friendly Neighborhood."
What Are Research Analysts Called As In US Markets?  And Do They Also Have Such Certifications ? Qualifying Exams ? Like Series XV
But need to clear CAT exam right for IIM calcutta ?
or for executive courses not required ?
For most Exec pgmes not required
Generally which are off campus ....online ..or hybrid model
Ek khatam nahi hua aur dusre ki baat kahe chhed rahe ho?
Need mba in finance for Research Analysts sebi certification
"Almost took the IIM-C IB, course but due to conflicting timelines/Interest had withdrawn appl 2 days before the commencement. Only 10 year work ex required nothing else. "
"No, 5 years .. just checked on their website.."
did they refund your fees ?
Well 5 is min and 10 is preferred. No interview round if you are 10+. Yed got my refund.
"How much is the fees ? 10/6/24, 2:22 pm - SA: Folks, to make stats interesting I have created a google form to analyze our cohort and understand some  interesting insights.  https://forms.gle/TKQFJB9WbMB7GZVM6 Disclaimer: I am not collecting or asking for personal information / email address - nor will share outside this group. The responses are multiple choice questions.  If we get enough people to fill honestly, we can get some interesting statistics and understand where we are placed collectively.  ( Pardon me I havent created many Google Survey forms, this may be quite off )"
Looking At The Programme Content!  It's Almost The Same As NiSM PGP
which is the best platform to view real time market data??
Yaar lena toh padhega na  Otherwise sebi registration nahi le paaenge
Is this relevant for the PM also ??
"You can add technical analysis in the questionnaire, for making investment decision"
And 2)  Fundamentals+ technical  3) Paid subscription 4) AI Modelling 5) Other.
And home minister and finance minister ?
"All along one thought PM means Prime Minister, maybe it is Portfolio Manager of A&A."
PM ke liye experience Chai ka dukan bhi Chalega
By PM i meant *Portfolio Management* specialization  Please clear my query too sir Sab puzzled hogya hai idhar
5 years Relevant experience under a sebi registered firm with a sub broker or sebi issued broker license.
Person_40 NaNi ji ko pilate rahe
Any Social Media Specialist or Image / video Editor in the group ? Need Some Info
What was the name of Indian book for accounting suggested by Latha mam?
Author? So many similar named books on amazon
There was another book by Indian author
"2 years for individual, 5 years for institutional Investment Analysts"
"rEAD ABOVE FOR pms  TResearch Analysts  FEES, RENEWAL FEES ETC..."
"I would like to correct that, for 1 cr aum it will be hardly 10k per month earning"
"For Portfolio Management Services, one himself need to be HNI....10 lakh registration fees and 5 lakhs yearly. Hence the total number is 260 in whole country"
Its 5 years if you apply for SEbi ria in your name
Sir ek bar regulation parh lijiye...SEBI website mein se hi dia hain
Waise jokes apart...the CFA book is really good ..topics are explained very well..  Statistics in itself appears to be easy to understand..but dhiraj sir is making it complicated owing to his explaination skills  
Sir is Using Person_34 words ! And Speed ( Person_39 Bharat Speed )
Yes CFA book explains very well.
In fact in a few areas it gave explanations different from what Person_42 sir did.
It is going on..just fill up his Google form for more DATA points
"As per my understanding, to get to the holy grail of being a PM , without any other experience in SEBI registered firms, one has to first put in 5 years as an Research Analysts, then 2 years as an Investment Analysts and then you’re eligible to apply."
Although with that method the problem is that SEBI says any persons involved in fund management decisions also need to be adequately qualified.
Could you pls share fhe link?
I mean...as an Investment Analysts also u can handle clients above 50 lakhs
We can easily do it even now..
Just bear with me for a minute
You cannot have a profit sharing model through any other license.
"As an Investment Analysts, you can only charge on assets."
But it is obviously going to be very tough to ask someone unknown..
Plus obviously you cannot execute trades also.
To give u 50 lakhs for managing..
Varna option selling on own capital
Anyways..after pms registration...one need to go to friends and family first
We should also divide groups into commerce and non commerce candidates
It's not like..u become pms. And people start giving u money for managing
Anyways one will have to start with aquintances
I know so many funds who have scaled up from managing 100cr 5 yrs back to 1000cr today.
They started with 100 crores just after getting pms license?
Ek doosre ko de dete hain
I doubt just because I have a pms license someone will trust me with 50 lakhs plus amount
Everyone will start with 5 lakhs or 10 lakhs in the beginning..
Which is out of net of pms
our batch strength is 85 rite ?
So I think this Portfolio Management Services is for those who are already well known in market..
Rancho says - Excellence ke liye padho success (50L) khud tumhare peeche aayegi
how come 87 members in the group ?
Arre i have 2 mobile numbers..
Investment Analysts has revenue cap per client...can't charge more than that
We all know how legal stuff works..
Traffic rules ke according toh bohot fine hai
"Fir se Research Analysts, Investment Analysts and Portfolio Management Services pe charcha chalu"
How many of us are going legally there?
How many businessman in this group are paying gst in total revenue ?
How many of us are following all rules by heart?
We are discussing legality only....outside of rules toh one can do anything
There are ways of doing things..
But atleast if u have basic liscense...doing everything else should be fine
Atleast this is my point of view
I mean...u cannot suggest stocks with price targets..so oneol obviously need liscense.e.
But how we are actually going to work..should also be clear in our minds..
So that we choose right option out of ra ia e.t.c
It's like..u need a basic driving license to be on road..it's super important..
But then how u drive..is a different story
As long as you are within the rules
I have and I have paid a fine....and I shouldn't be doing that
Arre Person_5...we are discussing rules here....not how to cut corners
Hello everyone   Should we have a separate group for all NISM PGP related documents?  Would be easier to navigate for everyone?
Ohhk..I just shared my Person_13 opinion ..obviously we have personal choices
We can do a lot without ever getting caught but that's not we are discussing here
So even going legally..for all practical purposes..pms seems a little bit out bound to me..
Portfolio Management Services is practically impossible for a lot of us...it's like setting up a big firm with lots of overheads and risks
Ya..exactly..it seems like it is mainly for those who are already Investment Analysts or Research Analysts for years..
Or those who have built great connections over years and has earned a good reputation as a stock market expert over years..
I don’t have the complete idea about FPI’s but a lot of Indian fund managers are going that route
Setting up as an FPI in Singapore or Dubai to avoid taxes
Basically avoiding the 42% tax bracket on trading which AIF’s give in India
Anyone has any input on that? Please share
But can you not partner or work with other firms?
Now people are also doing it through GIFT city in India..it's for fpi..it has special privileges for them..
One of my relative in HSBC told me about it
I think everyone here is talking about going alone and forming a company. The power is in the group. The amount of clientele that a group can handle by doing cross analysis etc is much productive and result bearing.. Look at Bridgewater associates for example. Look at creating value by adding some more talent and scale it up… Scaling businesses happens by collaboration only
Yes in fact that's what I think I might do....work for a Portfolio Management Services
Ya this seems to be a good option for Portfolio Management Services..undoubtedly 
"There are special law applicable for drawing investment, and dispute settlement and other legal compliance."
But Portfolio Management Services itself has to be a body incorporate?
Then is it allowed for one Portfolio Management Services to work for another Portfolio Management Services?..
Ohk..means if we start a pms...we will need our own clients..
Which again brings us back to square 1
PM is an individual....Portfolio Management Services is a firm
Ohhk...so after selecting PM in this course.. 
One can work for Portfolio Management Services..
Then it's a good option for those who are willing to work for some pms
"The way I’m thinking about it is, Research Analysts can be a good start to building a client base. When you are eligible, if you can convert 10% of your client base to contributing to your Portfolio Management Services, it can work."
Obviously the main assumption here is that we have a good track record and beating the index! Otherwise this thought is pointless
"Don't worry paaji..sebi will be saving us big time! U just need to say.. ""I am not allowed to share past performance as per guidelines"" To ur incoming clients"
That's the diff point altogether....beating index funds will be more and more difficult in the future
In future it's going to be tough..
But I will strictly adhere to the sebi guidelines of not sharing past performance..  No rule should be broken
"Can’t share past performance, can’t give future guidance"
"This is the approach, I am planning to follow Research Analysts to Investment Analysts to PM and finally if things turn up AS PLANNED a Portfolio Management Services .   Be gentle let Journey be slow but sure. Circumstances can be different for each , for me it's like a second carrier in due course of time."
"Yes, this is a long term game."
A friend had posted NISM books all series  ...request if can be reposted pls
Yes best to build credibility and contacts and trust at each stage to scale up more and more into next stage
"Hi... This is Meenal.. But until u hv license , nobody is going to trust u"
Same here .. might work for a Portfolio Management Services
"Good morning. Anyone got the soft copy of   Financial Accounting – A Managerial Emphasis – R Person_24Swamy, 7th Edition, PHI learning Pvt. Ltd. – 2022 (*Prescribed book)?  Not sure if it was shared in the group earlier."
"7th edition is the one, specified in our curriculum"
Interesting perspective on Power of Attorney route for 'legally' managing client accounts..
Though it is specifically not allowed for Research Investment Analysts to take Power of Attorney from clients..
P  National Security Advisor - cant take over the army.
It has been updated in students portal.
Let me check mine also-- Last time I fell asleep hope they didn't notice it
You have received the link at your email id with the admission letter

"noted your nomination, thankyou sir, will wait for views.  Rotational CR or not is NISM domain, they may be looking to simplify interaction to 6 instead of 86. Rotation may get too busy."
Go ahead bro.. rotation will not be accepted by NISM as appointment of CR is betterment of communication

Only 4 have opted for Investment Analysts in the poll. Have to figure if two CRs are required. Research Analysts has max members.
Thanks for your faith and trust Sir ...but with commitments I have I may not be able to fulfill the responsibility which this role warrants
But what does the role require? It will be just regular update/ announcement and follow up
"yes, interaction with the group here, update information/discussion with Nism and update Nism of group members views/interest/ need for support.  Ideally someone who can spare time and help us."
"that is a best guess, have to figure as we go."
"Hello all, I would like to volunteer as one of the CR for Research Analysts, if others are fine with it  I am an entrepreneur with 1 company and 3 firms running in almost automatic mode..  Busy mainly during market hours as I am also a trader  Can happily spare time for this group of super smart intellectuals .. I am sure it will help me build better relationships with u all for a lifetime  "
"Futures CRs, please is put up a poll to nominate CRs, there are too many *I nominate someone and so* messages going around."
For Research Analysts.    and  are almost final
"good idea, create a poll with option to add seld"
"did Person_21 Agarwal comment Person_2, would he have time to spare"
"I am always here to help whenever needed, irrespective of whether I am CR or not"
For Research Analysts .. I think it's done with CR...
"are you okay with being CR, Person_21"
 Sir if possible kindly create one na  I will pin it  
"I am completely ok being CR but I would have suggested to have people who aspire to be an Research Analysts, are new to field to be CR. They will learn more "
"Please vote two Class Representatives for Research Analysts OPTION: Person_7 (14 votes) OPTION: Person_21 (12 votes) OPTION: Person_63 (4 votes)  13/6/24, 2:46 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
"no nomination confirmations for Investment Analysts/PM, will create poll after acceptance by proposed CR"
I nominate  sir as one of the PM CR..because I believe his diverse experience in the field is genuinely going to help upcoming PMs   sir..if possible plz go fir it
Thanks for considering however I won't be able to handle this responsibility.
"will accept at end of day or tomorrow, in case no alternate is available"
I think we should once check with  if we need specialisation CRs for now
 Ya..he himself asked for 2 CRs..that's why this excercise  
Because as of now we are at basics and the specialisations will last only in last two trimesters
please interact with others who have chosen Investment Analysts and come up with a name Person_10
"Those who are casting votes, kindly cast in 2 options.."
Yes..and if anybody else want their names to be added in the poll..plz let us know
As we need 2 CR for each specialization
"I m all in for adi  Ek bar ask  if he is interested, he might be busy with his office, if he wants to then"
"Hello all, you may remove my name from the poll as I recommended myself since nobody else was coming forward from last so many days.   I support inclusive policy and will again recommend rotational CRs (atleast on Trimester basis) to increase participation"
For rotational CRs we have to ask  sir..
I don't think they will have any objection in case the proposal is presented effectively
Infact I also request if female members of our group can come forward and share this responsibility   Females are much better in organising
"I said earlier also, I am ok being CR. Will be experience"
Yes i read that after texting   I voted
But as always I will revert any query where I am tagged or DMd
"Hello Person_50, Kindly suggest  ji for an AMA session on Specialisation (License, Pre-requisites and scope of work etc)."
"To,  Respected  sir, NISM,  SUBJECT : PGP-24-25 students’ humble Request to conduct a Special session on all three course streams PM/Investment Analysts/Research Analysts  Resp. Sir, Since last week we are having continuous discussion in our whatsapp group over which stream to choose out of Investment Analysts/Research Analysts/PM. In order to facilitate our final decision making while choosing a particular stream, we request you to kindly help us reach out to some expert who can conduct a special session encompassing all aspects of these three streams. We are looking for clarity regarding : 1) Scope of the specialization. 2) License related eligibility and fees. 3) Compliance requirements.  We humbly request you to conduct this session for us, so that we can choose the stream which suits us the most and can shine as a NISM alumni.  Special Request : We would expect the host/organizer to be someone who can touch upon all aspects of these streams and who is in complete know-how of the subject matter. "
"hi guys, please help me edit this so that we can add more info ..."
"Once format is finalized, i will share a google sheet here, those who want a special session, please kindly put your name there using nism email id,  i will email the undersigned google sheet along with this letter, so that sir may get convinced about genuine demand for such a session"
thanks for attesting it advocate saab

"Those who want a special session for details about various streams, kindly put your NAME and YES under the UNDERSIGNED. Fill using NISM email id only"
"we need more and more people so that NISM team take it seriously. 13/6/24, 6:06 pm - ~ Person_29 pinned a message"
Person_35 guys .. but specialisation will be chosen only after 1 yr course is  completed..
"We need that session at the earliest. Because it will help us making the decision and depending upon license criteria, we can act immediately rather than waiting for more months..."
There is push to finance minister to reduce the criteria of  experience...
Not able to edit... Can you please put my name... Yogesh kulkarni
I can ask my compliance person to also do a session for all
"We should rather maintain a Master sheet for all our questionnaires regarding each Specialisation and share with everyone than nomination sheet, Caz everyone has some or the other confusions, so nomination is out of question.   Purpose -->  - This sheet is very important and can be updated by anyone while the AMA sessions progress.  - This will help us to *consolidate all our doubt and answers in 1 place, a master sheet* .  - Else there will be never ending discussions in the group till the end of the course time. To avoid redundancies. "
"right bro! in the same sheet SHEET 2 i have created format for questions, all queries can be entered there by participants.."
"True ,  We Can Have Predefined Q's !"
 Is A Perfect CR !  Appreciate Your Efforts & Initiative Bro !
1 Spoc person should ask all the Qs.
"try now, i hope you will be able to do it"
This is also a great idea Person_46
But will they ask for payment of some fees?
"When you are an Research Analysts, yes"
 ji and  sir..kindly fill in ur name in this sheet also if u want such a session
Ya..for Research Analysts kindly vote..if anybody want their name to be added..kindly inform

"I have two doubts.   1. Can we do all three in this same program? 2. If yes, do we need to pay any fee separately?"
Yes per programme 60K PLUS 18% GST
Not in the same year....you can do the other 2 in subsequent batches....you just need to do that 1 trimester
"noted, thank you, will list your name for Investment Analysts if no one else accepts"
Keep me in last option please
"sure sir, will wait till tomorrow afternoon"
